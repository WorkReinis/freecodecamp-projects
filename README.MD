## 📚 freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my personal submissions for the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certification projects.

## 🎓 Certifications Covered

- 🖥️ Responsive Web Design
- ⚙️ JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- 💡 Front End Libraries

Each project is in its own folder, with source code and (when applicable) a live demo link.

## ▶️ Running the Projects

- Projects built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be opened directly in a browser.
- Some projects (especially JavaScript algorithms) may require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

For setup and usage details, check the `README.md` file inside each project's folder.
