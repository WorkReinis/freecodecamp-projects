## freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my personal submissions for the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certification projects.

## Certifications Covered

- 🖥️ Responsive Web Design
- ⚙️ JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- 💡 Front End Libraries

Each project is in its own folder, with source code and (when applicable) a live demo link.

## Running the Projects

Most can be opened directly in a browser, however Front End Libraries projects require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
