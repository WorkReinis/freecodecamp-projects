## 🌐 freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my personal submissions for the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certification projects.

## 🎓Certifications Covered

- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Front End Libraries

Each project is in its own folder, with source code and (when applicable) a live demo link.

## 🏗️ Project Setup

Most can be opened directly in a browser, however Front End Libraries projects require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
