# freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my personal submissions for the freeCodeCamp certifications.

## Certifications Covered

- 🧱 Responsive Web Design
- ⚙️ JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- 💡 Front End Libraries

Each project is in its own folder, with source code and (when applicable) a live demo link.

## Running the Projects

Some projects can be opened directly in a browser (HTML/CSS/JS), while others require Node.js.

Check each subfolder’s `README.md` for specific instructions.
