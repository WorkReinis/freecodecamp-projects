## Sustainable Architecture

Check out [ArchDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/) for more info.

Here is some \`inline code\` for demonstration:
\`\`\`javascript
function designBuilding() {
    console.log("Designing a sustainable building!");
}
\`\`\`

Here are sustainability strategies:
- Use local materials
- Incorporate green roofs
- Optimize energy efficiency

> “Green architecture is not just about energy efficiency; it is also about creating buildings that contribute positively to the environment and community.” -Unknown

**Architects should emphasize innovation in design.**
